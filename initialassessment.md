### Company Name
Kambly
### Company Website
https://kambly.com/en/
### Company Industry
It is a company in the food industry (mostly confectionery and snacks).
### Describe in 2-3 sentences what the company does
It is a pretty famous swiss company which mostly creates high quality biscuits and other sweet treats. They have been founded over 100 years ago in 1910. Kambly is based in Trubschachen which is really close to where I live and I know quite a few people who have previously worked there drugin their summer breaks. That's why I chose this company for my project. 
### Company Strategy (public)
I'm not sure how to differenciate between their strategy and vision. They have sort of put it all together in the following text: https://kambly.com/en/all-about-kambly/our-responsibility/

Here is a little summaries of the points they mention.

- Sustainable development
- Local souring (of ingredients)
- Environment friendly packaging
- Employee friendly management
- Excellence (very high quality products) -> this is where my idea comes to play :) 
 
### Company Vision (public)
- See previous question
### From having a look at the company, what idea came to your mind? (Steckbrief)
I have a friend who used to work at Kambly before beginning his studies, where a big part of his job was manually inspecting biscuits on a conveyor belt to ensure they met the quality standards. He expressed how tedious and mentally exhausting this task was. I thought that this could be efficiently managed by AI. That's why my idea for Kambly is to integrate an AI system that can detect and identify defective biscuits. Such an AI could save Kambly quite a bit of money by replacing the need for dedicated employees for this specific task. 

### How would you rank the company's «AI Maturity»
I think it's a little hard for me to guess Kambly's AI maturity because they don't mention anything about AI on their website but based on what my friends who have prevously worked there told me I don't think they use AI in any way. My guess would be that the AI maturity of Kambly is 1 or 2.
### Did you check the company about open job positions in the field of data or AI?
They currently don't offer such a position.
